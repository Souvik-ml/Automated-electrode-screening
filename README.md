# Automated-electrode-screening
This repository contains the automated pipeline for the determination of voltage profile for 2D MT2 type material with the help of fine tuned CHGNet model for Li, Na, and K ion batteries. The only input is unit cell of 2D MT2 type material and the output will be voltage profile for Li, Na, and K
